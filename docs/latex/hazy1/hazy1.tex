{\small
{\em Cover image:}
Cloudy's simulation of the outer region of the Perseus galaxy cluster. 
The figure shows resolved fine-structure one-electron doublets
such as Fe XXVI. 
A spectral resolution of $R=0.25$~eV and a log column density of 24 were used. $J$-splitting of the 
one-electron $n$P$-1$S lines is a major improvement in this
release of Cloudy, as described in Gunasekera+2024.
