# class pdr
# ====================================

This is the dense phase model presented by LePetit, Roueff, and Herbst 
in order to reproduce C2 and C3 column densities observed along the line
of sight to zera persei.  This is our attempt at reproducing their calculation.
This is the dense molecular phase, not the phase that produces H3+ 

# >>refer	model	pdr	Le Petit, F., Roueff, E., & Herbst, E. 2004,
# >>refercon	A&A, 417, 993

If you do a thermal equilibrium calculation by removing the constant temperature
command the kinetic temperature will be about three times larger than
assumed in their paper.
