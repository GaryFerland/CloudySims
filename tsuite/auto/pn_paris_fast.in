# ========================================
# 


This is one of the "standard" models computed at the Paris meeting on
photoionization and shock calculations.  A table in Hazy compares the
predictions of the current version of CLOUDY with predictions of a
few of the other codes.

The model is meant to represent a planetary nebula ionized by a very
hot central object.  As a result there is a great deal of He++ and
the associated line and continuum emission is very important.
