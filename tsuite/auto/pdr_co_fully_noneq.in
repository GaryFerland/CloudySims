title H2 and CO are fully molecular, non-equilibrium case
# this is a pair with pdr_co_fully.in, which does not include non-equil chem
#
# commands controlling continuum =========
blackbody 5000
luminosity total solar linear 2
brems 6
luminosity total solar log -2.7
# 
# commands for density & abundances =========
# set the density and composition, ism with grains
hden 10
abundances ism no qheat
#
# other commands for details     =========
# this is an important ionization source
cosmic ray background 
# code will stop at 4000 K by default, lower this temp so we
# can do fully molecular gas 
stop temperature 10K linear
#
# commands controlling geometry  =========
# the radius and thickness
radius 15.8 
stop thickness 6
##>>chng 06 jun 02 add turbulence of 3 km/s
turbulence 3 km / s
# this turns on non-equilibrium chemistry as suggested by Federman et al. 1996
